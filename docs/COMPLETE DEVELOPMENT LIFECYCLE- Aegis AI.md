# **COMPLETE DEVELOPMENT LIFECYCLE**

This project will go through:

# **🔷 6 Major Phases**

---

# **🟢 PHASE 1 – Architecture & Contract Freeze**

### **🎯 Objective:**

Lock the foundation before coding.

### **Expected Results:**

* Finalized system architecture  
* Finalized folder structure  
* API contracts frozen  
* DB schema frozen  
* Risk scoring formula frozen  
* Tool policy structure frozen  
* Service boundaries clearly defined  
* Git workflow defined  
* Mock response structure ready

### **What This Phase Achieves:**

* Everyone can start working independently  
* No future integration conflicts  
* Clear responsibility ownership  
* Technical scope locked

---

# **🟢 PHASE 2 – Core Firewall MVP (Rule-Based System)**

### **🎯 Objective:**

Build working runtime security layer WITHOUT ML dependency.

### **Expected Results:**

* FastAPI firewall running  
* Prompt interception working  
* Rule-based injection detection implemented  
* Session logging working  
* Tool invocation policy enforcement working  
* Risk scoring engine functional  
* Mock ML integration placeholder  
* Basic API returning risk object

At this stage:

System works as a functional runtime firewall.

Even if ML never finishes, you still have a demo.

---

# **🟢 PHASE 3 – Injection Detection ML Integration**

### **🎯 Objective:**

Replace rule-based injection logic with trained ML classifier.

### **Expected Results:**

* Injection classifier trained  
* ML service deployed separately  
* Firewall calling ML service  
* Injection score coming from model  
* Model evaluation metrics ready  
* Explainability (basic reasoning or token-level attention)  
* False positive testing done

At this stage:

System becomes intelligent rather than rule-based.

---

# **🟢 PHASE 4 – Behavioral Modeling (UEBA for AI Usage)**

### **🎯 Objective:**

Introduce session-level intelligence.

### **Expected Results:**

* Feature extraction pipeline ready  
* Isolation Forest / anomaly model trained  
* Embedding similarity clustering implemented  
* Session anomaly score working  
* Behavioral deviation detection active  
* Repeated probing detection working  
* Final risk combining injection \+ anomaly

At this stage:

You are no longer a prompt filter.  
You are an AI behavioral intelligence system.

This is your differentiation phase.

---

# **🟢 PHASE 5 – Dashboard \+ Explainability \+ Live Monitoring**

### **🎯 Objective:**

Make intelligence visible and impressive.

### **Expected Results:**

* Real-time dashboard working  
* Injection timeline visualization  
* Risk heatmap  
* Session-level analytics  
* Tool violation alerts  
* Live WebSocket updates  
* Risk explanation breakdown  
* Attack simulation interface

At this stage:

Judges can SEE the intelligence.  
System becomes product-like.

---

# **🟢 PHASE 6 – Hardening, Optimization & Production Packaging**

### **🎯 Objective:**

Make system stable, demo-ready, production-like.

### **Expected Results:**

* Performance optimization  
* ML timeout fallback logic  
* Reduced latency  
* False positive tuning  
* Dockerized multi-service setup  
* Attack demo scripts prepared  
* Logs structured properly  
* Clean README & documentation  
* AMD narrative integrated  
* System stress-tested

At this stage:

You have a production-style prototype.
